# Kaggle projects kernels on specific datasets 
This repo contains my projects on competition or working with several datasets in kaggle. Kaggle is a website for arranging contests on Machine Learning and sharing datasets for data scientist across the world. This projects may help on you starting Machine learning and practicing data science in kagggle. 

### What you may learn here?
Here I've listed all of my kaggle projects on Machine learning and Artificial Intelligence. Some of my projects are done focusing on very introductory and detailed comments for machine learning beginners. I've quite good sample projects on Data analysis and visualization. You may check them for brushing up your Data science Knowledge. 

### Language and Libraries 
This project requires *Python 3.5* and the following Python libraries installed:
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [SciPy](http://www.scipy.org/)
- [Scikit Learn](http://scikit-learn.org)
- [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [Seaborn](http://seaborn.pydata.org/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/).

Install [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), a pre-packaged Python distribution that contains all of the necessary libraries and software for this project.
