# Intro to Python Data Visualization and Machine Learning using Iris Data
Simple project for visualizing iris species datset and identiying Irish flower species based on it's sepal and petal dimensions. In this notebook we'll play with IRIS data, an introductory datset for ML Learners. Here we will plot Iris data using python and will build machine learning models. Get your hands dirty!

## Data Set Information
This is perhaps the best known database to be found in the pattern recognition literature. Fisher's paper is a classic in the field and is referenced frequently to this day. (See Duda & Hart, for example.) The data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant. One class is linearly separable from the other 2; the latter are NOT linearly separable from each other.

## Attribute Information
- sepal length in cm
- sepal width in cm
- petal length in cm
- petal width in cm

## Class  
- Iris Setosa 
- Iris Versicolour 
- Iris Virginica
